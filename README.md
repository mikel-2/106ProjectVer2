# 106 Project Ver2 - Simulate and Recover

Version 2 of my individual project to test the reliability of the proposed EZ Diffusion Model. By using a Stimulate-and-Recover experiment, I attempted to see if parameters that were estimated by EZ match the original parameters that were used to generate the data in the first place.

I used ChatGPT to help structure my repository and fix up and refine code in order to meet the requirements for this project.

Of course, there are a few steps: Clone respository, run the simulation so results may be saved to "data/results.csv" and the summary will appear in the terminal. If pytest is installed, the test should run with a message confirming so. 

In closing, the analyses of this EZ model reveals a bias to average near zero, squared error decreases as sample size increases, and overall this EZ Diffusion Model results in great foundational strength for other cognitive modeling research and data analysis.
